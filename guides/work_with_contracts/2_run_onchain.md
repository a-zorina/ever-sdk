Core api is more flexible then AppKit and you can perform a lot of complex logic using it. But you will need to write more code with it as well :\)

You need to [define the contract in your node.js](../installation/3_add_contract_to_your_app.md) application before running its methods.

## About run

Run operation consists of few steps:

1. Creating a message;
2. Sending a message;
3. Receiving the message completion transaction;
4. Receiving external messages created by `return` function;
5. Decoding the messages bodies according to the ABI.

## Run on-chain

### Pattern 1. Run in 1 step: `process_message` method

The [process\_message](../../docs/mod_processing.md#process_message) method runs ABI-compatible contract method on-chain and returns the result transaction along with the external messages bocs, and decoded external messages bodies.

`process_message` performs all the run operation steps inside.

> **Note**: This is an easy to implement pattern to run, but we do not recommend to use it because of network inconsistency and application crash probability. For more reliable approach - use the Pattern 2.

For example, a contract has such method:

```text
// Function setting set value to state variable timestamp and returning it
function touchMe() public alwaysAccept returns (uint32) {
    timestamp = uint32(now);
    return timestamp;
}
```

Client method call:

```text
// Encode the message with `touch` function call
const params = {
    send_events: false,
    message_encode_params: {
        address,
        abi,
        call_set: {
            function_name: 'touch',
            input: {}
        },
        // There is no pubkey key check in the contract
        // so we can leave it empty. Never use this approach in production
        // because anyone can call this function
        signer: { type: 'None' }
    }
}
// Call `touch` function
let response = await client.processing.process_message(params);
console.log(`Ð¡ontract run transaction with output ${response.decoded.output}, ${response.transaction.id}`);
```

See the full sample in the repository with sdk samples:

### Pattern 2.  Run in 3 steps: `encode_message` -&gt;  `send_message` -&gt; `wait_for_transaction`

To run a contract method, first you need to create a run message:

```text
// Encode the message with `touch` function call
const params = {
        abi = {
            type: 'Contract',
            value: contract.abi
        },
        address,
        call_set: {
            function_name: 'touch',
            input: {}
        },
        // There is no pubkey key check in the contract
        // so we can leave it empty. Never use this approach in production
        // because anyone can call this function
        signer: { type: 'None' }
}

// Create external inbound message with `touch` function call
const encode_touch_result = await client.abi.encode_message(params);
```

Now the message should be sent. `sendMessage` method returns the the last block created in the shard before the message was sent.

```text
// Send `touch` call message to the network
// See more info about `send_message` here  
// https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_processing.md#send_message
shard_block_id = (await client.processing.send_message({
    message: encode_touch_result.message,
    send_events: true
    },logEvents
)).shard_block_id;
console.log(`Touch message was sent.`);
```

After the message was sent we need to wait for the transaction starting from the last shard block:

```text
// Monitor message delivery. 
// See more info about `wait_for_transaction` here  
// https://github.com/tonlabs/TON-SDK/blob/master/docs/mod_processing.md#wait_for_transaction
const touch_processing_result = await client.processing.wait_for_transaction({
    abi = {
        type: 'Contract',
        value: contract.abi
    },
    message: encode_touch_result.message,
    shard_block_id: shard_block_id,
    send_events:true
    },
    logEvents
)
console.log(`Touch transaction: ${JSON.stringify(touch_processing_result.transaction,null,2)}`);
console.log(`Touch fees: ${JSON.stringify(touch_processing_result.fees,null,2)}`);
```
