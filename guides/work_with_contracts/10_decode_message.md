# Decode Message

SDK can decode ABI-compatible External Inbound, External Outbound and Internal messages.

## When you may need it?

ABI-compatible contracts generate abi-compatible messages, or, to be exact, abi-compatible message bodies :\)

These messages are of 3 types:

* External inbound. It is for example, deploy message or run message. 
* Internal message. It is when one contract calls another contract it sends an internal message. These messages are constructed with target contract ABI. 
* External outbound messages. These can be of 2 subtypes:
  * Events - these are also specified in contract ABI. [Read more about working with events here](6_work_with_events.md). 
  * Return- these are generated by contract function's return.

So, if you have ABI on hands, you can decode these messages.

You can use both full message boc for decoding and only message body for decoding.

## Let's decode!

Core SDK provides `decode_message` method for full boc of message decoding and `decode_message_body` method for only message body decoding.
